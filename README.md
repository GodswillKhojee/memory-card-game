# memory-card-game

Repository Description

This project is a memory card game developed as our first-year college group project by a team of four: Godswill Khojee, Kaviraj, Krishna, and Lakshay.

The game tests a player’s memory by matching pairs of cards and includes three difficulty levels:

1. Easy – beginner-friendly gameplay

2. Normal – a moderate challenge

3. Hard – for quick thinkers and memory masters

This was our first experience working together on a project, giving us a chance to learn coding, problem-solving, and teamwork while building something fun.
